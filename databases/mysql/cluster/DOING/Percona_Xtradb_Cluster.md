Percona Xtradb Cluster
==============================

_**by Mark Nielsen

This covers Percona InnoDB Cluster. It involves Clusterset and the Router. Supposedly Percona Galera Cluster is no
longer supported because MariaDB bought Galera. Percona had Galera Cluster for over 10 years. The Percona
Cluster is very similar to Oracle Cluster with Clusterset and Router.

* Invalid variables start with number. Can start with a letter (A-Z or a-z), underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
* int myMethod( ) { }
  * int is the return type.
  * myMethod is the method name.
  * () indicates no parameters.
  * { } is the method body.
* For x* = 1 + 2 and X = 10. Answer is 30. You do everything on the right
and then you multiply it. x*=1+2 is x* = 3 is X*3 which is 10*3 which is 30.
Basically, you do everything on the right and apply the sign.
* For an if condtion in a print
   * a=2; b=1; System.out.println(a > b ? "2 > 1" : "1 < 2");
   * This will print : 1 < 2.
* Initilize an array
    * int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    * int numbers[] = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

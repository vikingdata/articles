This for an Ubuntu system. One thing that could be added is to check the facts variable for type of operating
system, the version, and if resources are available. For this article we will assume it is the latest
Ubuntu with enough resources. 


* Test if "installed_mysql" variable exists.
    * If not, define the variable.
* Run a test if 3 files exist or if mysql package exists (for ubuntu).
* Run a test if mysql is running. Abort if so. 
* Test if "installed_mysql" variables is equal to 1.
* If not installed, install it
* Test if custom mysql is installed, if it is abort.
* If not,
    * install it
    * Copying config files.
    * initialize it
    * Have it start on startup.
    * Change default password
